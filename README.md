# DiscordBot
Discord bot with ChatGPT API and SQL database for logging server events.

## Features
### Chat GPT
#### Overview
My Discord bot is designed to answer questions directly in chat using the ChatGPT API. This means that users can ask the bot any question they have, and the bot will respond with a relevant answer generated by the ChatGPT model. This is a great way to provide instant assistance and support to users, as they can get their questions answered quickly and easily.

#### Function Calling
During an API call, functions are specified to the models. These models are capable of intelligently generating a JSON object that includes the necessary arguments for invoking those functions. It's important to note that the Chat Completions API itself does not directly call the function. Instead, it generates JSON output that is utilized to make the function call.

Here is an example of function to get the current date & time. 

```py
def get_todays_date(timezone='US/Eastern'):
    """Get the current date and time based on the timezone"""
    tz = pytz.timezone(timezone)
    today = {"timezone": timezone,
             "today": str(datetime.datetime.now(tz))}
    return json.dumps(today)
```

ChatGPT intelligently recognizes when to invoke this function and uses the information to generate a response.

### Server Dashboard
In addition to answering questions, the bot also writes events with usernames and timestamps to a MySQL database hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This means that you can keep track of when users are interacting with your bot, and what commands they are sending. This information can be used to improve the performance and effectiveness of the bot over time, by analyzing the data to identify trends and patterns in user behavior. 

Basic summaries of the data can be found in the server dashboard (https://peterdinklage.streamlit.app/) displaying information like monthly messages by user or the number of times a user has had the 1st message of the day.

### Games
Here it's being used to log and record who sends the first message of the day. Users will send a command as close to the stroke of midnight and the event will be recorded to the database. This has become one of the most popular games on our server!
